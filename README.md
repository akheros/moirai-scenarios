# This repository contains moirai scenarios shared by the community

Each scenario is self contained. Read their `README`s to see how to install and 
play them. After following the install instructions, it is recommended to create 
vagrant boxes and play the scenario using those boxes. See 
[here](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/boxes/base.html) on how to create a 
vagrant box.
